# SA1-Old
Older SA-1 patches that did not follow the SA-1 Pack file standard.

*SA-1 Patch* contains the regular patches that only enabled basic SA-1 support on SMW without special mappers or code modifications.

*SA-1 Pack* contains work in progress initial concepts and ideas of the SA-1 Pack but they did not have the proper file structure to be merged with the main SA-1 Pack repository.
